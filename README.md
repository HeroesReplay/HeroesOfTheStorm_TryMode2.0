A modified Try Mode to create a better experience on Heroes of the Storm - Try mode.


## Editing Asset Files (.dds)
Recommended using Photoshop plugin [NVIDIA Texture Tools for Adobe Photoshop](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop) to do so. 
When saving, remember to choose `No MIP maps` inside the `MIP Map Generation` section. 
*(Took me a long time to figure it out why the texture is not loading.....)*
